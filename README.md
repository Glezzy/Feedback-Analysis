### Generalized Classification

### IMDB Targeted Improvements

## Conclusion of Generalized Classification 

We have successfully performed sentiment analysis on three seperate feedback databases for Amazon, Yelpm and IMBD. We can see that the classifier that we built had varying rates of success for each database. Considering that each company performs different kinds of business it might be the case that depending on the company, customers use different words to describe positive and negative feedback. This is especially true when comparing them to IMDB which is used for movie reviews where differents phrases are used to described positive or negative feedback. 

To test this hypothesis we will specifically look at the IMDB feedback and try and perform a more case specific sentiment analysis to see if we can get a better result using words more often used to  describe movie reviews.
